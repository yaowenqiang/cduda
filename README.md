# Python/Django Tutorial Sample for VS Code

* This sample contains the completed program from the tutorial [Using Django in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django). Intermediate steps are not included.

To run the sample:

1. In VS Code Terminal, run `python -m venv env` to create a virtual environment as described in the tutorial.
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + P and run command `Python: Select Interpreter`. If possible, select the interpreter ending with "('env': venv)"
3. Activate the virtual environment by running `env/scripts/activate` if you are on Windows or run `source env/bin/activate` if you are on Linux/MacOS.
4. In terminal, run `pip install django`.
5. Create and initialize the database by running `python manage.py migrate`.
6. From Run and Debug section, select `Python: Django` launch configuration and hit F5.

* For steps on running this app in a Docker container, see [Python in containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/quickstart-python) on the VS Code Docs website.

# Known issues

- CSS is lost if you set `DEBUG=False` in settings.py; the workaround is to include an added script at the end of dockerfile.txt to serve static file differently. See [Issue 13](https://github.com/Microsoft/python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial/issues/13) for details.
